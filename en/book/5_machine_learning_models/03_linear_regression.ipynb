    "## Arguments of `LinearRegression`\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned, linear regression in scikit-learn is quite simple, with few arguments that have little influence on the model's behavior. We have:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `fit_intercept` (boolean, optional): indicates whether to calculate the intercept (also called \"y-intercept\"). By default, the value is `True`.\n",
    " - `normalize` (boolean, optional): indicates whether the predictor variables (also called \"features\") should be normalized. By default, the value is `False`.\n",
    " - `copy_X` (boolean, optional): indicates whether to make a copy of the predictor variable matrix (`X`) before fitting. By default, the value is `True`.\n",
    " - `n_jobs` (integer, optional): indicates the number of parallel jobs to use for fitting the model. By default, the value is `None`, which means a single job is used.\n",
    " - `positive` (boolean, optional): indicates whether to force the coefficients to be non-negative. By default, the value is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important argument is `fit_intercept`, which determines whether to fit a model that includes an \"intercept\". The intercept is the value of the function when all predictor variables are equal to zero. If `fit_intercept=True`, the model will include an independent term. If `fit_intercept=False`, the model will not include an independent term and will pass through the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other arguments have minor effects on the fitted model. `normalize` is used to normalize the predictor variables, which can be useful if the variables have different scales – and you haven't normalized them previously. `n_jobs` controls the number of parallel jobs to use for fitting the model, which can be useful if multiple CPU cores are available – although it's only used in some special cases. Finally, `positive` will force the coefficients to be non-negative, which can be useful in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes of linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The class also has some interesting attributes that might be useful in some situations. The most useful ones are `coef_` and `intercept_`:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `coef_` attribute is a one-dimensional array containing the regression coefficients, one for each input variable in the dataset. The order of the coefficients corresponds to the order of the predictor variables in the input data matrix used to train the model. This can be used to determine, to a limited extent, the importance or weight that each variable has within the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `intercept_` attribute is a scalar that represents the value of the dependent variable when all predictor variables are zero. For example, in a linear regression model that predicts house prices based on their size in square meters, the independent term could represent the base price of a house. In this case, the value of the independent term could be used to determine if our algorithm is correctly estimating the price of a \"base\" house.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a simple example – a small dataset representing house prices in relation to their dimensions in square meters."
