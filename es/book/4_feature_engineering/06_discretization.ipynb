    " - To try to improve the model's generalization capabilities\n",

    " - Reduce the impact of extreme values (outliers)\n",

For example: instead of counting how many times a user visited a page, we only want to know if they visited it or not. It can also be useful to differentiate between extreme values and those that are not, for example in ages, we could say that someone who is over 100 years old is an extreme case and mark it with a binarizer.\n",
